## Dependencies
Probably can be built on Ubuntu but I tested on archlniux only.

* Docker
* sudo

#### Adapted from

https://jootamam.net/howto-initramfs-image.htm

## TODO
setup the archlinux rootfs with locale and such

Might be the reason why can't

`man systemd` or `man systemd.network` inside the guest.

### Also
can't do this in a chroot
```
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate
```
